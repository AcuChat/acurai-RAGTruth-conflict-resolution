# "100% Hallucination Elimination Using Acurai" Data Repository

This repository contains the dataset for our paper "100% Hallucination Elimination Using Acurai". The data documents responses reported by the [RAGTruth Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00396) from GPT-4-0613 and GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613 to queries from the RAGTruth Corpus. The data also contains the responses from the same models, using the same temperature, using the same queries, using the same passages, with the passages and queries transformed by Acurai. The data documents that the Acurai transformation eliminated the hallucinations in all four datasets.


## Dataset Organization

Files are organized by model and hallucination type:

```

```

## Data Format

### Fields
- `id`: Unique RAGTruth identifier for each evaluation instance
- `query`: Original RAGTruth query
- `passage_1`: First RAGTruth passage 
- `passage_2`: Second RAGTruth passage 
- `passage_3`: Third RAGTruth passage 
- `model_response`: Response generated by the base model
- `acurai_response`: Response generated by base model with Acurai query and passage transformations
- `annotator_notes`: JSON array containing human annotator evaluations

### Example Annotator Notes
```json
[{
    "start": 21,
    "end": 48,
    "text": "bulbs, also known as tubers",
    "meta": "SUBTLE CONFLICT:\nAIGC: bulbs, also known as tubers.\nOriginal: tubers (like bulbs)\n",
    "label_type": "Subtle Conflict",
    "implicit_true": false,
    "due_to_null": false
}]
```
