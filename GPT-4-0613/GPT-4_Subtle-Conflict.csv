It's important to check the bottom of the dish to ensure it can withstand extreme temperatures. Once confirmed, the precooked chicken pieces are spread evenly in the dish or pan, making sure to maintain equal spacing between them. Once arranged, the dish or pan with the chicken pieces is placed in the refrigerator for several hours, typically between 6 to 8, before reheating.
